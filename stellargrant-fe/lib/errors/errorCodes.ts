/**
 * StellarGrants SDK — Contract Error Codes
 *
 * Exhaustive registry of every numeric error code that the StellarGrants
 * Soroban contract can return. The numbers are taken directly from the
 * contract's `Error` enum (see `stellargrant-contracts/src/errors.rs`).
 *
 * Keeping codes here as a plain const enum means:
 *   1. They are erased at compile time (no runtime overhead).
 *   2. They can be used as both type and value in switch statements.
 *   3. A single source of truth shared by the mapper and the SDK.
